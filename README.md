# nutrition_facts
Create an empty webpage.
Download nutrition.xml from https://gist.github.com/3000322 and place in your project folder.
Use AJAX via jQuery or JS API to fetch the file into the page.
Create a table. For each <food> in the XML file, create a row in the table with the food name and nutritional facts - serving size, calories, carbs.
Bonus: Use the tablesorter jQuery plugin to make the table sortable by the nutritional facts.
